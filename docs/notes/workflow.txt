-----------------------

ISSUES:
	- Not learning the exact equations for advection reaction.
	- CDF results are slightly better (?)

TO DO:	
	- Replicate Burgers' equation with the new solver (to debug the solver)
	- Replicate Simple advection equation
	- Write code to display existing data
	- Write code to clear up files that are manually deleted


MANAGE DATA:
	- Save MC results metadata and display them
	-  

COMPILE RESULTS
	- Plot coefficients as a function of reg or other variables (MC etc)
	- Plot accuracy as a function of ref or other variables (MC etc) 



TESTS:

Test cases:
	- Burgers'
	- advection reaction
		- u**2
		- u
		- ... ?
	- linear advection

Results variables (accuracy and score)
	- PDF vs. CDF
	- Function of regularization 
	- Function of MC count 
	- Function of initial distribution
	- Function of dx, dt, du

KDE test variables:
	- getting rid of delta effect
	- u_margin effect
	- normalize effect

Optimization tests:
	- Attempt L2 regularization with known terms
