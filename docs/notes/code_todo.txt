TO DO NOW:


- Closure vs non-closure error in random K advection reaction.
- Plot MSE_path with coefficients.

- Compare optimization methods (giving different results).
- RFE iterations might get rid of relevant terms.
- Bandwidth function of Error BAR plot.

- Debug learning issue with returning trivial solution.
- Try excluding terms in equation.

- RUNS:
	- Advection-reaction MC
		- Get Cross-Validation Error instead of Test-Error
			- Use min(mse_path) for error
			- plot error function of regularization

----------------------------

	

	- Advection-reaction boundary effect

	- Advection-reaction coeff function of RFE iterations: figure for sparsity and coefficients

	- Burgers Coefficients and error function of Regularization

	- Try bigger range eps=1e-2 (instead of 1e-3) [include as input]
	- Function to clear up files that are manually deleted
	- Function to Replicate learning results
	- Implement better RFE
	- Get Cross-Validation Error instead of Test-Error

	- Unify __init__.py files
	- fix adjust params to use percentage rather than numbers.
