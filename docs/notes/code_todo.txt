TO DO NOW:

* CheckDir exists only ICparams [should happen before not after the run]
* Files for running experiments with specific purpose - e.g. Test effect of MC, test effect of u_margin, delta etc.
* DataAnalysis module for reading data, displaying it, plotting it, 


- Data Analysis:
	- Display data
		- MC
		- PDF
		- Learning
	- Plot learning data and save.

	- Function to clear up files that are manually deleted
	- Function to Replicate learning results

- Runs:
	- Try learning advection without a source term (analytically).
	- Learn advection with random K
	- Test the effect of initial distirbution
		- Try using simpler initial distirbutions(with less randomness)
		- How does the delta function affect the results?
		- 

- Code fixing:
	- Try bigger range eps=1e-2 (instead of 1e-3) [include as input]
	- Setup simulation, trying different parameters, skipping if run already exists.


	- Unify __init__.py files
	- decrease float precision in saved data..
