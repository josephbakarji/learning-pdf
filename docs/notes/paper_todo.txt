* Advection with nonlinear Source
	- Setup
		- Single gaussian for reaction equation.
	- Results:
		- Approximations for lower order coefficients.
		- Error/score and coeffs as a function of regularization coefficient.
		- (?) Error as a function of discretization width.
	- Plots

- experimental setup:

- potential experiments:
	- error as a function of number of Monte Carlo realizations

Conclusion:
	- We showed it kind of works
	- We discovered that it could be used for debugging
	- We want to try it for nonlocal equations and conservative discretizations
